Predict crop production using historical data on state, district, crop type, season, year, and area. The project uses a Decision Tree Regressor trained on preprocessed data (categorical features encoded with one-hot encoding) and evaluates performance using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared (R²). The trained model is saved with pickle for future predictions.

Usage:

Clone the repository.

Install dependencies: pandas, scikit-learn.

Run main.py or the provided Jupyter notebook to train and test the model.
